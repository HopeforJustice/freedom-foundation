				A missing and endangered 14-year-old girl who ran away from home and was
				picked up off the streets by a much older man was safely recovered by
				Hope for Justice because someone had received our training in Tennessee.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>A friend of the girl’s mom knew about the signs of human
				trafficking and the work of Hope for Justice because of this training,
				and told her to contact us. Our investigators quickly established that
				there were many different reasons to believe the girl was at high risk
				of being trafficked. They coordinated with volunteers from among the
				girl’s family and friends to launch a search party, putting up ‘missing’
				posters, canvassing the neighborhood and homeless camps through
				outreach, and reviewing footage from home security cameras and
				surveillance cameras nearby.<br></br>
				<br></br>
				Hope for Justice investigators interviewed more of her friends and
				relatives to get the facts, and scoured online sources to track her
				down.<br></br>
				<br></br>
				After several days of surveillance and research, someone who had seen
				one of the missing persons posters called their sheriff’s office and
				said they had information. Separately, Hope for Justice received
				information about a Facebook message that had also been sent and,
				together with police, recovered the teen and brought her home.<br></br>
				<br></br>
				Hope for Justice established the key facts about who picked her up off
				the streets and why, and learned of other potential victims linked to
				the case. A police department with which we often work closely has now
				opened an official human trafficking investigation, based on this
				intelligence. We cannot share more information publicly while the
				investigation continues and for the protection of the 14-year-old girl.
				We are continuing to support the family
